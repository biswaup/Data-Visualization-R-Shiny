# Interactive-Visualization-R-Shiny
The project has been done as part of the course curriculum. It is a Shiny web app consisting of data visualizations on the dataset europe.csv.
The code uses:
1.  R
2.  GoogleCharts

The code is not very clean or crisp, but is fully functional. It consists of the following things:
1.  Interactive bubble chart with k means clustering
2.  World map
3.  Bar plots based on overall mean
4.  Interactive grouped bar plots
5.  2D and 3D Scatter plots which interact between each other unidirectionally
6.  Interactive Datatable which refreshes with change of slider values
